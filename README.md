Fun project that will soon be converted into a fullstack app with Python backend logic, 
Fast API (preemptively) and React + Node + Tailwind  & Vercel for a cool personal project to tackle three things at once:

1. Learn how to apply and model DE's so I can start applying them to my trading...
2. Learn more programming so I can actually code my SaaS ideas!
3. Have a fun problem to solve
